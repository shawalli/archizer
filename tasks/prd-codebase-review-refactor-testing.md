# Product Requirements Document: Codebase Review, Refactoring, and Testing Improvements

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines a comprehensive codebase review and refactoring initiative for the Archizer extension. The primary goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and test coverage by identifying and addressing code quality issues such as dead code, duplicative logic, overly aggressive/repetitive patterns, and inadequate testing. The focus will be on the entire codebase excluding test data, sample data, and demo files, with particular attention to maintainability and performance improvements.

## Goals

1. **Code Quality Improvement**: Remove all commented-out code, dead code, and never-executed code paths
2. **Code Deduplication**: Eliminate overly repetitive and duplicative code while maintaining reasonable DRY principles
3. **Test Coverage Enhancement**: Achieve >80% code coverage through comprehensive unit testing
4. **Test Reliability**: Ensure all tests pass with `mise run test` command
5. **Maintainability Enhancement**: Improve code structure and readability for future development
6. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and address performance bottlenecks and overly aggressive patterns

## User Stories

- **As a developer**, I want to work with clean, well-tested code so that I can confidently make changes and add new features
- **As a developer**, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can refactor code without breaking existing functionality
- **As a maintainer**, I want a maintainable codebase so that I can easily understand and modify the code
- **As a user**, I want the extension to work reliably so that my Amazon order archiving continues to function properly

## Functional Requirements

1. **Code Review and Analysis**: The system must systematically review all source code files (excluding test/demo/sample files) to identify:
   - Commented-out code blocks
   - Dead code and never-executed branches
   - Duplicative functions and logic
   - Overly aggressive or repetitive patterns
   - Performance bottlenecks

2. **Code Refactoring**: The system must refactor identified issues by:
   - Removing all commented-out code
   - Eliminating dead code paths
   - Consolidating duplicative logic into reusable functions
   - Simplifying overly complex or repetitive patterns
   - Maintaining DOM interaction contracts (same DOM changes/additions/deletions)

3. **Test Coverage Improvement**: The system must:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all source code
   - Achieve >80% code coverage
   - Ensure all tests pass with `mise run test`
   - Ensure the project can build with `mise run build:dev`
   - Use `mise exec node -- npm` for any direct calls to `npm`
   - Test both happy path scenarios and edge cases
   - Focus on unit tests only (no integration tests required)

4. **Code Quality Standards**: The system must ensure:
   - All functions have appropriate unit tests
   - Code follows maintainability best practices
   - Performance is optimized where possible
   - DRY principles are applied appropriately (allowing basic code copying when justified)

5. **Test Framework**: The system must use Jest as the primary testing framework for consistency with existing setup

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Integration testing (focus on unit tests only)
- Refactoring test data, sample data, or demo files
- Breaking overall functionality contracts
- Modifying DOM interaction behavior (except for amazon-orders-early.js redundancy)
- Achieving 100% code coverage (target is >80%)
- Performance optimization that compromises maintainability
- Refactoring the popup code structure (only adding unit tests if needed)

## Design Considerations

- Maintain existing UI/UX behavior and DOM manipulation patterns
- Preserve extension functionality contracts
- Focus on code structure and testing improvements rather than visual changes
- Ensure refactored code maintains the same external API behavior

## Technical Considerations

- Use Jest as the testing framework for consistency
- Maintain compatibility with existing build and test infrastructure
- Ensure `mise run test` command continues to work
- Preserve existing extension manifest and configuration
- Focus on source code files in `/src` directory
- Exclude coverage reports, build artifacts, and test data files

## Success Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: Achieve >80% test coverage across all source files
- **Test Reliability**: 100% of tests pass with `mise run test`
- **Code Quality**: Zero commented-out code, dead code, or never-executed branches
- **Maintainability**: Reduced code duplication and improved code structure
- **Performance**: Identified and addressed performance bottlenecks

## Open Questions

1. Are there specific performance benchmarks or metrics we should use to measure improvements?
2. Should we prioritize certain types of code quality issues over others during the review process?
3. Are there any specific areas of the codebase that are known to have performance issues?
4. Should we establish any specific coding standards or linting rules as part of this initiative?
5. Are there any external dependencies or APIs that might be affected by our refactoring efforts?
