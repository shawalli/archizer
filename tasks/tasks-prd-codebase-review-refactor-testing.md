### Next Priority
All test coverage tasks (3.x) are now complete! Move to **Phase 4.0**: Code Refactoring and Cleanup

## Code Quality Issues Summary

### Critical Issues (High Priority)
1. **dom-manipulator.js** - 2473 lines, extremely oversized file that needs to be split into multiple focused classes
2. **amazon-orders-early.js** - Overly aggressive injection strategies with redundant code and performance issues
3. **google-sheets-api.js** - Incomplete implementation (just TODO comments)

### Major Issues (Medium Priority)
1. **tagging-dialog.js** - Code duplication between `addNewTag()` and `addTag()` methods, overly complex initialization
2. **amazon-orders.js** - Complex initialization logic, duplicate order processing callbacks
3. **order-parser.js** - Large methods that could be broken down, complex DOM traversal logic

### Minor Issues (Low Priority)
1. **background.js** - TODO comments for incomplete features
2. **popup.js** - Some methods could be simplified, minor code duplication
3. **extension-loader.js** - Empty placeholder methods, some console logging
4. **storage.js** - TODO comments, excessive console logging
5. **storage-migration.js** - Excessive console logging

### Common Patterns Across Files
1. **Excessive Console Logging** - Production code has extensive console.log statements
2. **Code Duplication** - Similar patterns repeated across multiple files
3. **Mixed Responsibilities** - Classes handling multiple concerns instead of single responsibility
4. **Complex Methods** - Methods that are too long and handle multiple responsibilities

## Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: File Splitting and Restructuring
1. **Split dom-manipulator.js** into:
   - `ButtonManager` - Handle button creation and injection
   - `OrderStateManager` - Handle order hiding/showing state
   - `EventManager` - Handle event binding and cleanup
   - `DOMManipulator` - Main coordinator class

2. **Split order-parser.js** into:
   - `DataExtractor` - Handle data extraction from DOM elements
   - `PageFormatDetector` - Handle page format detection
   - `OrderParser` - Main coordinator class

3. **Split tagging-dialog.js** into:
   - `TagManager` - Handle tag operations
   - `DialogManager` - Handle dialog UI operations
   - `TaggingDialog` - Main coordinator class

### Phase 2: Code Deduplication
1. **Extract common button creation logic** into reusable utility functions
2. **Consolidate similar data extraction patterns** across different data types
3. **Create shared validation utilities** for common validation logic
4. **Extract common DOM manipulation patterns** into utility functions

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
1. **Simplify amazon-orders-early.js** injection strategies
2. **Optimize DOM observation** in order-parser.js
3. **Reduce redundant event listeners** and observers
4. **Implement proper cleanup** for all observers and event listeners

### Phase 4: Code Quality Improvements
1. **Remove excessive console logging** from production code
2. **Implement proper error handling** with specific error types
3. **Add input validation** for all public methods
4. **Implement proper TypeScript-like documentation** for better code clarity

### Phase 5: Testing and Coverage
1. **Fix existing failing tests** before adding new ones
2. **Implement comprehensive test coverage** for all new classes
3. **Add integration tests** for complex workflows
4. **Implement test utilities** for common testing patterns
5. **Fix skipped tests by simplifying complex methods**
   - Break down TaggingDialog.renderTags into smaller, testable methods
   - Simplify TaggingDialog.processTagInput by extracting DOM manipulation logic
   - Refactor DOMManipulator.injectButtons into smaller, focused methods
   - Create proper test utilities for complex DOM mocking
   - Re-enable and fix all 8 skipped tests

### Phase 6: Incremental Refactoring with Test Fixes
1. **Refactor incrementally, fixing tests as you go**
   - Each refactoring step should improve testability
   - Re-enable skipped tests after each architectural improvement
   - Use existing tests as guardrails during refactoring
2. **Maintain test safety net**
   - Keep all 144 passing tests working throughout refactoring
   - Use tests to validate refactoring doesn't break functionality
   - Add new tests for refactored components
3. **Iterative improvement cycle**
   - Refactor â†’ Test â†’ Fix â†’ Re-enable skipped tests â†’ Repeat

## Success Metrics
- **File Size Reduction**: dom-manipulator.js reduced from 2473 to <500 lines
- **Code Coverage**: Achieve >80% test coverage (currently 20.45%)
- **Test Reliability**: 100% of tests pass
- **Code Quality**: Zero commented-out code, reduced duplication
- **Performance**: Eliminate redundant injection strategies and observers
